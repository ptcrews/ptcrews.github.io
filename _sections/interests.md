This page lists some of my interests and organizations I have been involved
with. It is split into two major categories, [technical](#technical) and
[personal](#personal). The technical section contains my interests that relate
to technical fields, while the personal section contains my more creative or
activity-based interests.

## Technical

### Applied Cybersecurity Club
{: #applied-cyber}

The Applied Cyber club at Stanford has been a large part of my undergraduate
career. As one of the leaders of the club, I have helped run several major
workshops and events, while also working on interesting programming projects
relating to computer security.

## Personal

### Photography
{: #photography}

One of my more creative passions is photography. I greatly enjoy taking photos
as it requires that I seek out beauty in the world, which I often overlook.
I am working on collating and posting a selection of interesting photos that
I have taken.

### The Outdoors
{: #outdoors}

My other large passion is the outdoors. Having grown up in Washington State,
I had the opportunity to spend a large portion of my youth in the woods and
doing outdoor activities. I greatly enjoy backpacking, hiking, and skiing, and
am always interested in finding and experiencing new places.
