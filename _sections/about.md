I am a software engineer at Google, working on credential infrastructure
security. I am passionate about designing and implementing systems with
**strong security guarantees** that solve real-world problems.

Prior to joining Google, I was a student at Stanford University and did
research on the Tock operating system focused on implementing the 6LoWPAN
networking stack. I was also the president of the Applied Cybersecurity club,
and participated in the CCDC and CPTC competitions.
