I am a first-year CS PhD student at Stanford, interested in security, systems,
and formal methods.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a software engineer at Google working on
credential infrastructure security.

I was previously an undergrad at Stanford, and did research on the Tock
operating system focused on implementing the 6LoWPAN networking stack. I was
also the president of the Applied Cybersecurity club, and participated in the
CCDC and CPTC competitions.
