I am currently a student at Stanford University, studying computer science with
a focus on designing **resilient**, **secure**, and **efficient** systems. I am
passionate about solving interesting, impactful problems in novel and
unorthodox ways, and I greatly enjoy exploring how changing underlying
assumptions and abstractions can lead to new solutions.

[My research and implementation work](#projects) has largely focused on
**embedded systems** and **networking**, though I have also done work involving
**distributed systems** and **operating systems**. I greatly enjoy working on
systems within these fields as they are critical components of services that
people rely on, and working on these systems has a direct, real-world impact.
Further, these fields are helping to change how society, technology, and the
world works. As a consequence, these systems must be resilient, efficient, and
secure.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy the outdoors and photography.  Both of
these hobbies require me to pay attention to the world around me, and lets me
focus on details that are otherwise ignored. Having grown up in Washington
State, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time backpacking and exploring
trails around the Cascade Mountains. Alongside photography and backpacking, I
am also a fairly avid skier.
