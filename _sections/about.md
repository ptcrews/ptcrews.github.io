I am currently a student at Stanford University, studying computer science
with a focus on designing reliable, secure, and efficient systems. I am
passionate about solving interesting, impactful problems in novel and unorthodox
ways, and I greatly enjoy exploring how changing the underlying assumptions and
abstractions can create new opportunities for designing systems.

My research and implementation work has largely focused on three areas:
**networking**, **embedded systems**, and **security**. My interest in these
fields is due to their commonalities - a need for resilient, efficient, and
practical systems designed to solve impactful problems in novel ways.
Additionally, these areas are rapidly becoming important underpinnings for
society, and are changing fundamental assumptions about what systems look
like and how we interact with them.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy the outdoors and photography.  Both of
these hobbies require me to pay attention to the world around me, and lets me
focus on details that are otherwise ignored. Having grown up in Washington
State, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time backpacking and exploring
trails around the Cascade Mountains. Alongside photography and backpacking,
I am also a fairly avid skier.
