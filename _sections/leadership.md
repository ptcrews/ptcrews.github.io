## Applied Cybersecurity Club

![Applied Cyber Logo][applied-cyber-logo]

I was president of the [Stanford Applied Cybersecurity
Club][applied-cyber-website] from 2017 until 2019, and I helped establish the
club as an official Stanford student orgianization in 2018. As president, I was
responsible for organizing weekly talks, workshops, and events to help
interested students learn about computer security. I also helped run and
participated in collegiate computer security competitions with other members of
the club, winning first place at the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition
(CPTC) in [2017][cptc-victory-2017] and [2018][cptc-victory-2018].
