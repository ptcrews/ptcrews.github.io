Below are some of the major projects I've worked on. They are split into two
main categories - research and implementation.

## Research

### [The Tock Operating System](https://www.tockos.org/)
The Tock research project is an embedded operating system written in Rust.
The goal of the project is to improve the security of low-power, IoT devices
by leveraging Rust's compile-time guarantees.

My work on this project has largely been focused on the networking stack. I
am implementing a UDP/IPv6/6LoWPAN stack on Tock, which is slowly making its
way into the mainstream kernel. You can check out my code for this project
on my fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/ptcrews/tock).

### SOSP 2017 Workshop
As part of my involvement with the Tock project, I helped run a workshop on
using Tock at SOSP 2017 in Shanghai.

### 6LoWPAN

## Implementation
For implementation projects,
