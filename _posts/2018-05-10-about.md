I am currently a student at Stanford University, studying computer science and
focusing on building secure, reliable systems. I have a passion for making
computers do things they shouldn't, and getting them to do so reliably. My
favorite projects are those where things really shouldn't work, but they
somehow do.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy the outdoors and photography.  Both of
these hobbies require me to pay attention to the world around me, and lets me
focus on details that are otherwise ignored. Having grown up in Washington
State, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time exploring trails around the
Cascade Mountains. I am also a fairly avid skier.
